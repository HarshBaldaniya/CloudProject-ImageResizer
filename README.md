# Image Resizer Cloud Project

This is a cloud-based Image Resizer API that can be used to resize images on the fly. It can be integrated with any application that needs to resize images on demand. The Image Resizer Cloud Project is built using Firebase Functions, a serverless compute service provided by Google Cloud. Firebase Functions allows developers to write and deploy serverless functions that can be triggered by various events, such as HTTP requests, database changes, and authentication events.
